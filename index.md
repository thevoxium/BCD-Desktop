Our aim is to make a Brest Cancer Detection application using Deep Learning. In the later stages of the project, we aim to integrate Super-Resolution and Grad-CAM to visualise the predictions made by the model. This project also has an automatic mailing system to directly email the reports and scans to patients with just a click. We plan to make the desktop app using Tkinter to keep it as minimal as possible. Furthermore, we are planning to deliever a web application built using Flask and a modern frontend to make it accessible to everyone without the need to install anything.

More details about the idea and some notes can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Deep-Learning-Project-c40d22f8e1cf45c384e353e403f56918)
